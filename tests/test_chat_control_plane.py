"""Control-plane contracts under the single-path ruling + Phase 2 DIRECT gating.

The router-level SSE compatibility is already covered end-to-end by
test_viewer_chat (TestClient + fake kernel asserts frame shapes). What is pinned
here is the pure policy + understanding surface:

* ``TurnRequirements`` defaults to an abstain;
* the default policy (all experimental lanes off) keeps routing on AGENT — the
  formal path certifies ACTION only, everything else rides its own lane gate;
* Phase 2: a short, pure, zero-demand turn maps to DIRECT ONLY under the DIRECT
  gate; any capability demand, memory flag, or a closed gate routes to AGENT;
* L0: the in-process signal engine sets confidence correctly from cheap facts;
* the orchestrator's registry resolves the right branch and degrades unmapped kinds
  to the agent branch, never hard-failing.
