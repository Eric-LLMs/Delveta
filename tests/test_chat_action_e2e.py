"""Phase 5A e2e through the real /chat/stream: ACTION dispatch + the lossless-fallback
consistency contract.

The user-visible invariant these cases pin:

* certified action, gate ON → the tool's deterministic confirmation streams with the
  legacy content→done shape; NO LLM channel is used, the Agent is never entered;
* abstention / preflight failure → the Agent receives the ORIGINAL user text
  BYTE-FOR-BYTE (no attempt markers, no notes — `_escalation_note` only rides branches
  that actually searched the corpus), so the same request behaves exactly like the old
  link with the fast path disabled;
* state-UNKNOWN failure → the Agent is NEVER re-entered (no duplicate side effect) and
  the stream finishes honestly;
* gate OFF → pure dark launch: the seam is never called and the Agent sees an
  untouched request.

Drives the router through the Phase-4 harness; only ``chat_mod._run_tool`` is
substituted (the adapter's runtime.execute classification is covered by the seed-tool
and executor unit tests, and the funnel-binding contract by the direct _run_tool case
at the bottom of this file).
