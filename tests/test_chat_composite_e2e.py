"""Phase 5B e2e through /chat/stream: COMPOSITE routing + the fence-inheritance
contract (constraint 2) + the parallel-input fan-out proof.

The viewer body rides the real router (same injection path as Phase 3) while the
private-recall branch runs through the Phase-4 seam double — one turn, two independent
inputs, ONE final generation. Escalations re-enter the Agent with:

* the SAME ``source_policy`` the plan resolved from the ORIGINAL request (private_first
  / private_only) — sunk into the agent context before dispatch, verified on the wire
  through the harness's recorded contexts;
* the honest-disclosure note (this branch DID search the corpus — unlike the ACTION
  branch's byte-clean hand-off, prepending here is the point);
* and, for the private_only case, the fence is then pinned at the enforcement layer:
  a Sandbox bound with the Agent's received context HARD-DENIES web_search even with
  a NETWORK grant + ALLOW rule (the constraint-2 end-to-end proof).
