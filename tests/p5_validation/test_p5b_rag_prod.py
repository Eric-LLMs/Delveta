"""Layer B — RAG (Phase 4) through the real /chat/stream + the source-policy fence.

These prove the Fail-Closed / honesty contracts the charter names:

  * a relevant recall answers grounded on the shared seam (one judge, one generation,
    the Agent is never entered);
  * empty recall / an irrelevant verdict / a seam error escalate to the Agent, and the
    honest-retrieval note rides ONLY a branch that actually searched the corpus;
  * the escalated Agent inherits the ORIGINAL request's source policy. Since the
    2026-09-26 operator ruling web_search is READ-classed (never pops an approval), so
    the fence (which HARD-DENYs the NETWORK class) no longer stops it — pinned below as
    the accepted opt-out; the fence mechanism itself stays covered for NETWORK tools in
    tests/test_chat_source_policy.py and tests/test_sandbox_research.py.
