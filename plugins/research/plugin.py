"""``research``: Phase 0.5 architecture spike — the six Research OS tools.

This is a **spike**, not the Phase 1 implementation: it proves the six frozen tool
contracts (`docs/research/15-cordis-plugin-contract.md`) can be mounted through the real
Cordis DI + ToolRuntime and exercise the six mechanisms (mounting, persistence/crash
recovery, three-layer storage, graph STALE cascade, gate override, idempotency). The
domain logic is deliberately thin and file-backed; a production build replaces
:class:`ResearchService` with the real repositories from the Phase 1 design.

Design notes (spike decisions, all auditable):
- **Factory-built, not discovered.** ``PluginManager.discover`` execs a *fresh* module per
  ``plugin.py``, so a module-level ``PLUGIN`` can never see the API's ``ctx``. Following the
  toolkit pattern (``apps/api/tools/toolkit/plugins.py``), this module exports a *factory*
  ``build_research_plugin(ctx)`` that captures ``ctx`` in tool closures, plus a
  ``register_research_plugins(manager, ctx)`` helper wired from ``apps/api/deps.py``. The
  file deliberately exports **no** ``PLUGIN`` attribute, so ``discover()`` skips it safely.
- **Lazy capability resolution.** Tools resolve ``drive``/``research_scratch`` at *execute*
  time via ``_service_for(ctx)``, not at build time — so the plugin stays a PENDING fiber
  until the capabilities are provided, which is exactly the Cordis mount contract we test.
- **File-backed spike persistence.** Per-owner JSON files under
  ``<research_scratch>/<owner_id>/<project_id>/`` (``project.json``, ``graph.json``,
  ``executions.json``, ``approvals.json``, ``artifacts/<artifact_id>/v<N>``), written with
  atomic ``tmp + os.replace``. No ``workflow_state.json`` is ever written.
- **Tenancy.** The acting user comes from ``core.infrastructure.request_context``
  (``get_request_user_id``); every project is scoped under the owner's directory.

        One task may hold at most one live run at a time (T4 invariant #2: concurrent
        Task A/Task B runs are fine, but a single task never runs two turns in parallel).
        A RUNNING slot older than ``stale_after_seconds`` is presumed dead — the owning
        process crashed before ``end_run`` — and is adopted: any RUNNING executions it
        left behind are flipped to ABORTED so the delete guard never blocks forever.

        ``new_edition`` (the desktop "Run" control on a task that already reached the
        terminal PUBLISH stage): PUBLISH has no legal next stage, so a plain resume would
        stop at turn 0 and produce nothing. This run instead starts a NEW edition — the
        run-scoped shared state is reset (stage -> DISCOVER, gates -> NOT_RUN, diagnostics
        and last_block cleared, evidence graph emptied) so the driver actually drives
        DISCOVER -> ... -> PUBLISH again. ``run_seq`` still advances (red line 1), so this
        edition's working copy lands in temp/v{N} + outputs/_v{N}. Earlier editions' files
        stay on disk for history, with ONE G3 exception: the previous PRIMARY report's
        version tree is ARCHIVED (moved, never deleted) under ``archive/run{N-1}/``, so the
        new edition's draft slot (v1) can never be base-hijacked by a stale higher-numbered
        version. For a task short of PUBLISH (mid-chain / blocked resume) the flag is a
        no-op and the run resumes from the current stage.

        drafts under temp/vN/scrape, and record server-side fetch provenance (E7) for
        this run.

        Contract (the E-series trust boundaries):
        - **E3** a code-level batch cap: more than 5 URLs (or a duplicate canonical URL
          in one batch) is a ``ValueError``, never fetched. The batch body budget
          invariant (P3-5) is ``n_urls × max_chars ≤ FETCH_BATCH_CHAR_CAP`` (150k).
        - **P3-7A** a URL this run already fetched-and-saved is NEVER re-delivered: the
          view comes back as an ``already_fetched`` reference (ids + lengths, no text),
          sharing the run's single copy of the page — the same source text enters the
          model context at most once per run.
        - **E7** every successful fetch records ``_fetch_provenance[canonical_url]`` in the
          run's ``cloud_assets`` ledger — ``verify`` later trusts only this record, never a
          model-supplied ``content_status``/length.
        - **E10** saves run concurrently under ``asyncio.gather``; a failed drive write marks
          that URL unsaved and is **not** entered into the ledger (no account skew). It never
          fails the batch.
        - **P3-2A CAS**: each URL is looked up in the global fetch cache first. A HIT skips
          only the network — the draft is still persisted as a fresh *current-run* asset and
          gets a full ledger entry (``cache_hit=True`` + original ``fetched_at`` +
          ``retrieved_at``), so E6/E7/E10 behave exactly as on a MISS. Eligible MISSes
          (usable, no secret-bearing query on request or final URL) are published to the
          cache best-effort after a successful fetch.
        - **P3-2B single-flight**: concurrent MISS fetches of the same cache identity in
          this process/event loop collapse to one network call (exclusive lease +
          generation-fenced takeover inside ``fetch_cache.FlightRegistry``); waiters get
          the shared envelope but keep their full per-run persist/ledger discipline.
        - Silent by contract (like ``save_scrape``): no run event / monitor wake-up per batch.

        made-up id — is refused with a precise error (never a blind drive read).

        ``READ_DEFAULT_WINDOW_CHARS`` — derived from the audit context_profile
        distribution, see constant) with ``total_chars``/``truncated`` metadata, so one
        read result can never re-inject an unbounded page into the model context; the
        next window is an explicit caller choice, not a silent full re-delivery.

        """Commit a batch of per-claim verifications in ONE atomic transaction (P3-1).

        The deterministic (no-LLM, no-network — constraint 1) vertical slice behind
        ``research_evidence action="verify_batch"``. Business semantics are *inherited*,
        not reimplemented: each pending item runs the exact ``_apply_findings`` core that
        single-claim ``verify`` uses (E1/E2/E7 + error classification, constraint 7), so
        batch ≡ sequential final graph (constraint 8).

        Delta-pending rule (constraint 2, frozen in ``plugins/research/batch.py``):
        an item is skipped iff this run's stored ``_verify_fps`` baseline exists, the
        claim passes the CLAIM_GATE predicate, and its ``evidence_fingerprint`` is
        unchanged. A legacy single-``verify`` anchor (no baseline yet) is therefore
        pending exactly once — the skipping call *stamps* the baseline, a pure
        bookkeeping write, never a re-derivation.

        Citations/strength are accepted as optional per-item patches and written in the
        SAME commit (this is the "补齐 citations" single-write that kills the
        verify→mutate double-anchor chain), subject to the same canonical-vocabulary
        normalization as ``record_node``/``mutate_node``.

        Commit protocol: the whole batch runs inside :meth:`atomic_update_project` with
        ``extra_files=["graph.json"]`` — graph + project.json + revision + ``_verify_fps``
        ledger become visible together or not at all (constraint 5). When every item is
        skipped and no stamp is needed the mutation returns ``False``: zero writes, zero
        revision bump (transaction-level idempotency, constraint 6). Structural
        validation errors reject only the offending item (partial isolation) — the rest
        of the batch still commits. P3-3 boundary repair: a stringified ``findings`` /
        ``citations`` JSON array inside an item is un-wrapped ONCE before those checks
        (audited via a per-item ``coerced`` tag); unparseable or wrong-container inputs
        reject exactly as before.

        ``server_authored`` (internal, P3-8) lifts ONLY the ≤8 item cap: the cap bounds
        a model-authored payload; a batch built by ``adjudicate_evidence`` is
        server-bounded already and must still commit in ONE transaction. Every other
        invariant (validation, delta-pending, fingerprint, single CAS commit) is
        identical on both paths.

        repair completion is admitted before and metered after — batch splits and
        format repairs included. Budget breaches (``StageBudgetExceeded``) and the
        run-level cost fuse (``CostLimitExceeded``) propagate to the caller; the
        pipeline node decides degrade vs terminate. ``None`` (tool/legacy path)
        keeps behavior byte-identical.

        The P3-8 atomic action that replaces the model-driven fetch/adjudicate/
        verify_batch retail chain. The outer agent triggers exactly ONE call; every
        step runs inside this plugin:

        1. fetch every source through :meth:`fetch_save_batch` (the P3-5 cap-5 is an
           internal loop detail — zero LLM round-trips per fetch batch);
        2. extract ONE deterministic representative chunk per page by Python slicing
           of the cleaned draft (per-source ``ADJUDICATION_SNIPPET_CHARS`` cap — no
           LLM summarisation anywhere in stage one);
        3. size the payload against ``ADJUDICATION_BUDGET_TOKENS`` and default to a
           SINGLE batch LLM call; greedy source-splitting adds a call ONLY on budget
           overflow (claims are the fixed per-batch context);
        4. collect and validate every reply (explicit source/claim ids — a
           hallucinated id is dropped, never trusted; ``insufficient`` is a
           relevance-only answer mapping onto verify's neutral no-ticket semantics);
        5. reconcile in Python memory and commit ALL verdicts through exactly ONE
           ``verify_batch(server_authored=True)`` — the unchanged P3-1 no-LLM commit
           core (constraint 1 preserved: the LLM here PREPARES findings; the commit
           stays deterministic CAS).

        The agent has ZERO awareness of any split: it sees one action and a compact
        per-claim verdict summary back.

        The P3-9 atomic action mirroring :meth:`adjudicate_evidence` for the REVIEW
        stage, final-contract edition:

        1. load the latest artifact version and every Claim node from the graph
           (required context, bounded by ``REVIEW_BUDGET_TOKENS``);
        2. ONE streaming LLM call over the WHOLE draft (thinking OFF — Run-13
           measured a 453 s prefill tax on the full-draft prompt; the 46-row patch
           output came from the draft+graph context, not hidden reasoning). The
           reply is ONLY
           ``{"changes": [{file,target,expected_old,change}, ...]}`` — no prose, no
           document echo;
        3. Python PRE-CHECKS every row (strict 4-key schema; unique-match iron rule:
           target exactly once, expected_old exactly once inside the target section),
           then applies them to an in-memory STAGING copy;
        4. all-or-nothing: every row passes → ONE ``create_version`` commits the
           staged draft (the graph is read-only here, so artifact + graph are by
           construction in the "all landed" or "untouched" definite state); any row
           fails → staging is discarded, nothing is written, a RuntimeError reports
           the exact rejects.
