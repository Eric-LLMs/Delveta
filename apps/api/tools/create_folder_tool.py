"""``create_folder``: create a folder in the caller's cloud drive (My Drive root by default).

Registers the SAME service entry the REST endpoint uses (``DriveService.create_folder`` —
validation, membership check, unique-suffix, repo write, audit log), so the LLM keeps the
capability as fallback for the chat fast path's ``create_folder`` allowlist entry. Every
``DriveError`` this call can raise happens BEFORE any write (name/parent validation,
workspace membership, collision) — the body re-raises them as ``"preflight: …"`` value
errors, the channel the ACTION executor reads as "provably not executed ⇒ safe to
escalate".
