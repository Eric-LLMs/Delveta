# ── Phase 5A direct-dispatch seam (see ChatDeps.run_tool contract) ──────────────────
# The ACTION executor calls the SAME ToolRuntime.execute the Agent loop uses: the
# pre-execute approval waterfall, monotonic sandbox guards and tool bodies are all
# inherited — this seam adds NO second execution framework, it only skips the ReAct
# flow control for turns L0 certified as fully-determined single-tool requests.
#
# Failure classification (side-effect boundary isolation):
#   * body raised / returned ``"preflight: …"``, unknown tool, invalid args, or ANY
#     failure of a READ-only tool  ⇒ the side effect provably did not happen →
#     ActionPreflightFailure → the executor escalates (Agent may clarify);
#   * pre-body DENIAL (approval refused / timed out / sandbox / source-policy guard) ⇒
#     decided, terminal, no side effect → {"ok": False, "reason"} — escalating would only
#     make the Agent re-trigger the same approval prompt;
#   * any failure AFTER a MUTATING tool body was entered ⇒ state UNKNOWN → raise so
#     the executor terminates honestly (never a blind Agent retry duplicating it).
#
# The pre-body / post-body split: a failure whose ``info["name"]`` is a BODY-stage tag
# (invalid_output, tool_error, post_blocked) or whose runtime message starts with a
# post-body marker below can only have arisen AFTER the tool body was entered, so its
# side-effect state is UNKNOWN. Every denial that fires BEFORE the body (pre-execute
# exception, ASK deny through the approval bridge, sandbox / source-policy guard) is
# provably side-effect-free. The approval-bridge deny reason is free-form CLIENT feedback
# (approvals.py: ``feedback or decision.reason or …``), so it cannot be matched by a prefix
# — hence the polarity is "exclude the runtime-generated post-body markers", defaulting the
# nameless case to a decided denial rather than enumerating every possible pre-body text.
