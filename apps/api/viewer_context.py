"""Viewer Context Provider — pure assembly logic (no DB, no drive, no retrieval).

The chat router freezes what the client extracted from the open viewer into a
:class:`ViewerPayload`; this module decides what reaches the prompt. There is **no
server-side intent matching for documents**: an open document's body is never injected —
the trusted ``## Viewer Access Context`` control section points the model at the asset id
and the ``read_document`` tool fetches it. A document's page/range scope is NOT the
model's to choose either: it is settled upstream from the viewer context
(``TurnFacts.viewer_page_from/-to``) by the funnel's acquisition handler, so the stub
carries no page-passing guidance. Only two things are injected as data:

- ``P0``: the user's explicit actions — pinned selections, image regions, captured video
  frames. These are actions, not inferred intent, and always ride.
- Video's media-time proximity: the ``[t-20s, t]`` subtitle window (and, on whole-video
  requests, the full transcript). Video has no tool channel — nothing on the tool side
  can fetch "the last 20 seconds of playback" — so it keeps regex classification.

Hard rules:
- The user message is never spliced; injection rides the ``run(context=…)`` channel.
- Video uses **media time**: the window is ``[t - 20s, t]`` extended to overlapping cue
  boundaries, the active cue (``start <= t <= end``) is always included, and future cues
  are dropped. No playbackRate math, no lookahead.
- Video FULL short-circuits honestly: over ``VIEWER_TOKEN_BUDGET`` → ``too_large``;
  untrusted capture → ``unavailable``. The router aborts before the agent runs — never a
  silent downgrade or a RAG fallback.
- Security: injected blocks are **untrusted reference data** — objective descriptions
  only, never instructions. We must not tell the model to call tools from inside a
  reference block; the block header pins the role, the fence isolates the content. The
  Access Context section is the opposite: trusted, app-generated, and it renders alone.
