"""Understanding Engine: the typed answer to "what does this turn need?".

``TurnRequirements`` is the OUTPUT contract of understanding (and of
:func:`resolve_requirements`); its owner is this module. It describes CAPABILITY
DEMAND ONLY — it has no knowledge of executors, policies or plans (the policy layer
maps demand to a plan; the executors carry it out).

:func:`resolve_requirements` is the in-process L0 signal engine: pure, no I/O, no
LLM. It reads facts the base context has ALREADY resolved (viewer assembly, attach,
research binding, memory trigger words) plus cheap lexical patterns on the raw user
message, and emits a requirement set. It never guesses whether a general-knowledge
question needs the web beyond a small time-sensitivity prefilter — anything it is not
certain about is reported ``ABSTAIN``/``LOW`` so the policy routes it to the full
Agent path (fail-safe, not fail-open).

The optional L1 fast-LLM arbiter (for AMBIGUOUS turns only) is intentionally NOT
wired in Phase 2: it would add a second model call to the very path meant to shed
latency, and the L0 set already covers the clearly-conversational and clearly-
capability-demanding turns it must distinguish. L1 arrives in a later phase behind
its own gate.
