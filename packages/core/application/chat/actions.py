"""Fast-path direct-tool dispatch: an ALLOWLIST over the existing tool registry.

Design invariant (Phase 5 charter): the fast path is a FLOW-CONTROL layer on top of the
capability system — it is NEVER a second capability registry. Every capability a
DIRECT_TOOL can invoke is a tool already registered in the agent's ``ToolRuntime``
(the model itself can call it through the normal loop), so an unrecognized or
partially-parameterized turn loses nothing: it falls through to the Agent + LLM + full
tool/skill/workflow machinery exactly as before the fast path existed.

Since the structure rulings (docs/temp.md 落点对表) this module carries
ONLY the L0 flow-control layer and the governance vocabulary. It is a TERMINAL
leaf: nothing importable from here may reach back into the funnel — funnel and
understanding import this module at their top level, so the moved names below are
served by an EXPLICIT lookup table, never by function-level imports.

  * :func:`match_direct_tool` — the L0 exact pass over the binding table;
  * :func:`is_negated_request` — the global negation guard (the funnel's
    :func:`guardrails.negated` is its public re-export);
  * the executor-governance exceptions (:class:`ActionSchemaError`,
    :class:`ActionPreflightFailure`, :class:`ActionIntegrityFailure`).

The PARAMETER EXTRACTORS + ``DirectToolSpec`` + ``DIRECT_TOOLS`` table moved to
:mod:`core.application.chat.intent_funnel.registry.plugins` (8.1-b roster — DAG
leaf, nothing in the chat layer is imported there); :func:`bind_arguments` and
:func:`validate_action` moved to :mod:`core.application.chat.intent_funnel.binder`
(the Binder node owns argument truth, 8.7). Historic ``from …actions import``
sites keep working through the lazy module ``__getattr__`` façade at the bottom
of this file — late-bound so the module DAG stays acyclic.

No execution, no authorization, no I/O here. The side-effect boundary is enforced by
:class:`~core.application.chat.executors.action.ActionExecutor` + the host seam (see
:attr:`ChatDeps.run_tool`): preflight-proven failures may escalate to the Agent; an
exception after the tool was entered is a STATE-UNKNOWN terminal failure and must never
be re-run through the loop (no duplicate folder / duplicate deck).

Phase 5A seeds: ``create_folder`` and ``add_term`` are REGISTERED as real tools first
(``apps/api/tools/*_tool.py``, auto-discovered) so the LLM keeps the same capability as
fallback; plus one already-registered single-shot atomic tool (``pdf_extract_text``)
whose ONLY parameter (the asset id) is fully determined by the request context.
Admission bar (verified per candidate, not by name): single registered atomic tool +
args fully determinable this turn + one deterministic sync/async return — anything
whose product path is a Skill/Workflow or whose tool body hides multi-step generation
stays on the Agent.
