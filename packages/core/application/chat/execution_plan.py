"""ExecutionPlan: the control plane's single execution contract + pure policy.

This module OWNS ``ExecutionPlan`` and the pure mapping function
``build_execution_plan(requirements, policy)``. The mapping is in-memory only — no
I/O, no capability probing, no authorization (those live in Pre-flight and the
executors). ``turn_orchestrator`` is a pure consumer of the result.

Phase 1 policy: fast paths are switched off globally, so every turn resolves to
``AGENT`` and the refactor is behavior-neutral. Later phases extend the mapping
below the ``fast_paths_enabled`` gate, one kind at a time (DIRECT -> VIEWER ->
LOCAL_RAG -> ACTION/COMPOSITE), each behind its own feature switch.
