"""TurnOrchestrator: the pure control plane between HTTP transport and executors.

Owns the per-turn state machine: plan resolution, executor dispatch, the approval
pump, the stream commit guard, the disconnect policy (T4 invariant #3: a research
turn is never cancelled by a client disconnect) and lifecycle finalization. It
never infers policy itself — it consumes an ``ExecutionPlan``.

SSE contract: events flow to the transport VERBATIM (same frames as the legacy
router emitted), so ``apps/web`` / ``apps/desktop`` need no change.

Commit Point (design §5 step 6): the first user-visible content delta. Until then
a branch may still fall back to AGENT; after it the channel is LOCKED — an error
can only terminate the stream with a standardized event, never re-route mid-flight.

                     live, the semantic+decision cascade gets a chance to name ONE

          (2) Argument Binding — capability + raw query -> structured arguments,
                     via the EXISTING action-binding table (``bind_arguments``).
                     Parameters undeterminable => no route (C1: the Agent, which
