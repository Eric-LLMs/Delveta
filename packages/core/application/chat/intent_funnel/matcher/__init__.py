"""Node 1 — Matcher: deterministic EXACT hits from the LIVE tables ONLY.

Live-table ruling (2026-09-26): the exact set is the enabled Standard +
Similar query sentences (``entry.intent_corpus`` over
capability_standard_queries / capability_similar_queries), normalized for
comparison; a HIT means the turn's sentence IS one of the human-curated
canonical phrasings, so ``matched_literal`` is always a readable sentence,
never a regex literal. Regexes, patterns, aliases and request examples are
NOT match data: they cannot produce a HIT at all.

A HIT proves the sentence was CURATED as this action — it does not prove a new,
similar sentence is an action; everything non-exact escalates to Recall +
ToolIntentModel (chain ruling). Global guards (negation, research/handoff veto)
live in the funnel common layer, not here — 8.1-a ruling.

Escalation discipline (8.1): no hit -> MISS (falls to Recall); one hit -> HIT;
several capabilities hit -> MATCH_AMBIGUOUS carrying ALL candidate ids upward
for ToolIntentModel. The Matcher itself never picks.
