"""Intent Funnel — the independent, decoupled routing lane above the Agent.

Design (docs/temp.md, "Chat 意图路由重构"), chain ruling 2026-09-24: one model
hop per turn — Matcher HIT -> ToolIntentModel, Matcher MISS/AMBIGUOUS -> Recall ->
ToolIntentModel (ONE call: capability selection + argument extraction from Candidate
Cards) -> Binder (normalize/validate) -> Shared Tool Runtime. Every failure
exits to the Agent, byte-identical. ToolIntentModel is a swappable provider
(local primary, online fallback, stub) behind the tool_intent/ ladder.

Scope status: P0 moved the orchestration out of ``TurnOrchestrator``; P1 added
the Registry/Matcher. Single path (ruling 2026-09-28): the funnel IS the formal
routing lane — the dark-launch gate (``chat_funnel_enabled``) and the shadow
hook were deleted; ``funnel_live`` only keeps the fail-open safety semantics
(missing deps / guardrail veto). The legacy QIR lane was deleted with migration
0014 (live-table ruling 2026-09-26) — ``funnel_live`` + ``route`` are the whole
public surface.

# LAZY re-exports (2026-09-24 structure rulings): ``funnel`` imports
# ``understanding`` which imports ``actions`` — eagerly importing funnel here
# would detonate a cycle whenever ``actions``' façade resolves its moved names
# (actions -> registry/binder -> this package -> funnel -> understanding ->
# actions, with understanding still half-built). Attribute access happens at
# CALL time, when every module in that chain is fully initialized.
