"""Intent Funnel orchestration.

The 2026-09-24 chain correction pins the ACTIVE target chain to one hop and
the 2026-09-26 live-table ruling retired the legacy QIR lane entirely:

    Matcher HIT  ─┐
                  ├→ ToolIntentModel (ONE call: select + extract) → Binder (validate) → Execute
    MISS/AMB → Recall ─┘

every non-COMPLETE outcome exits to the Agent (8.10). The recheck second hop,
the Decision LLM and the pre-Registry QIR cascade are all deleted. The chain
is gated by its own switch (``chat_funnel_enabled``, default OFF): with it
closed, route() returns the requirements object untouched."""
