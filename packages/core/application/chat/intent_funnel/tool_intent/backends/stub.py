"""Backend: deterministic margin rules over Recall candidates.

The transition stub of the cost ladder (§3 Node 3, "重构过渡期先让漏斗转起来").
It inherits the leader-vs-runner-up margin discipline the cosine corpus proved,
but with the CORRECTED exit: a too-close race is UNCERTAIN (escalate upward to
the Decision LLM), never a silent abstain-to-Agent (design §5: this is the
core semantic fix of the refactor).

Single-candidate races confirm when the candidate carries a trustworthy
provenance: a calibrated cosine (origin="recall") or a deterministic table
hit (origin="matcher_hit", score 1.0 by construction). Matcher-AMBIGUOUS
escalations (origin="matcher_ambiguous", score=0) are inherently "two table
patterns claiming the turn" — the stub never resolves those, it escalates.

Extraction power is zero by design: the stub answers WHICH, never WITH WHAT.
Its verdicts carry ``arguments=None``, so a stub-routed turn with a schema'd
capability exits BIND_MISSING to the Agent — the honest consequence of
pinning the ladder at the deterministic end.
