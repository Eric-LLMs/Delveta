"""ToolIntentModel backend: the LOCAL provider — the Docker ``tool-intent`` service
(8.17's first choice, ms-level when warm).

Deployment (compose): the service speaks an OpenAI-compatible wire, so the
provider seam is two-way swappable — the inference backend (Ollama today,
vLLM/llama.cpp as drop-ins) and the model itself (current default configured
via ``chat_tool_intent_local_model``; no model name exists in this code). Nothing
deployed yet means the default ``chat_tool_intent_local_url=""`` ->
:class:`ToolIntentUnavailable`, which the ladder treats as fall-through to the
online provider — never an abstain-to-Agent. When an endpoint exists, the
call obeys the payload discipline from :mod:`.base` (query + facts + cards in,
{capability_id, confidence, arguments} out — the same contract the online
backend serves, so the two are interchangeable above this module).

Wire: OpenAI-compatible — ``chat_tool_intent_local_url`` is a BASE url such as
``http://localhost:18091/v1`` (the compose ``tool-intent`` service). The bespoke
{system_prompt,prompt} protocol this file used to speak matched no real
server, and定型 it now costs nothing because there is no deployed consumer
to migrate.
