"""Prompt construction: the Candidate Cards the model sees, and the output lock.

Card assembly (8.17 #2/#3, Action-Contract ruling 2026-09-25): each Card is
built from the Registry row by capability_id — tool binding, tool description,
the CANONICAL parameter schema with per-slot descriptions, the capability's
SEMANTIC CONTOUR (query examples = intent corpus first + request_query_examples
as card context, and negative examples), the provenance line (table-evidence
label, or recall origin+score) and matched example. No tools list, no skills,
no conversation history.

OBSERVABILITY COMPAT: card-truncation warnings keep the historic
``...tool_intent.base`` logger NAME although the code moved here — caplog
assertions and log filters key on that string.
