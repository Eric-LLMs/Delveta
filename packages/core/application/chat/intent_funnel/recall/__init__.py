"""Node 2 — Recall: query -> scored hits, evidence only, never adjudicates.

Discipline (chain ruling 2026-09-24 + live-table ruling 2026-09-26): cosine
here is a QUALITY GATE (filter obvious garbage), the "which one" decision
belongs to the ToolIntentModel. The index is the LIVE corpus itself —
``capability_standard_queries`` / ``capability_similar_queries`` are the
runtime truth, so there is no version predicate and no snapshot pair any more.

Two INDEPENDENT vector searches per turn (Standard path + Similar path) over
ONE user-query embedding; the hit sets are simply concatenated. The retired
per-capability MAX/AVG merge is GONE by construction: every hit at or above
``min_score`` is kept as its own candidate with full provenance (capability,
sentence, kind, language, row ids).

Predicates: row enabled AND capability enabled+active AND embedding IS NOT
NULL — so until the out-of-band backfill (scripts/embed_corpus.py) has run,
the corpus is empty for scoring purposes and this node honestly reports
RECALL_UNAVAILABLE (8.10), never a half-index.
