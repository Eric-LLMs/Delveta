"""LEGACY binder lanes — compatibility-only, NOT on the active funnel path.

Everything here serves the L0/legacy action planes and historic import
surfaces, never the active cascade (which only calls :func:`..binder.validate`):

* :func:`bind_arguments` (capability + raw query -> structured args) and
  :func:`validate_action` (the executor's final schema gate) moved here from
  ``chat.actions``, which keeps a lazy façade for its historic import surface;
* :func:`bind` — extract-then-validate via the entry's declared plugin, kept
  for the L0/QIR-compat lanes and the p5 monkeypatch seam;
* the extraction ENGINE stays code (ruling 8.1-b): arg_slots declares WHICH
  source feeds each slot — ``user_input`` (default) or ``plugin:<name>``;
  the extractor bodies live in the registry roster
  (:mod:`core.application.chat.intent_funnel.registry.plugins`), which the
  publish gate validates and this module resolves. The Registry entry's
  ``arg_slots`` is the slot whitelist — anything an extractor returns outside
  it is dirty data, not an answer.

The active funnel must not import this module; entry is only through the
package façade (audited compatibility boundary).
