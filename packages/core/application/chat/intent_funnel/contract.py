"""Intent Funnel node contracts — the vocabulary every node speaks.

Chain ruling (2026-09-24, single-hop correction): the active chain is
Matcher -> (Recall on MISS/AMBIGUOUS) -> ToolIntentModel (ONE call: capability
selection + argument extraction) -> Binder (normalize/validate only) ->
Execute; every non-COMPLETE outcome exits to the Agent (8.10). The former
recheck hop and the Decision LLM node are removed from the active path —
``ToolIntentVerdict`` is ToolIntentModel's verdict+draft in one object. No node may pass
anything else across the boundary, and per 8.8 a verdict carries routing
metadata ONLY — never an executor, tool instance or authorization bypass.
