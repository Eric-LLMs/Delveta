"""ActionExecutor: the Phase 5A fast path — direct dispatch of an allowlisted tool.

Serves turns the policy resolved to ``PlanKind.ACTION``: L0 certified that the turn
demands EXACTLY one registered tool with fully-determined args, so the ReAct loop is
unnecessary flow — the seam calls the SAME ``ToolRuntime.execute`` the Agent would
(approval waterfall, guards, sandbox, ACL pipeline all inherited).

Stage order encodes the side-effect boundary isolation (Phase 5 hard constraint 1):

  1. existence + schema gate (live ``ToolRuntime.schemas()`` roster, then
     :func:`validate_action`) — pre-execution, side-effect-free; a tool the roster
     does not register is a C2 TERMINAL (the Agent never re-plans around a system
     fault); a malformed REQUEST (argument shape) escalates and the Agent owns the
     clarification; a routing-stamped ``binding_integrity`` marker (stage-2 C2)
     terminates first;
  2. seam presence — not wired ⇒ escalate (LLM fallback intact, capability unchanged);
  3. the seam call is the SIDE-EFFECT BOUNDARY. Before it: anything the seam can PROVE
     did not execute raises :class:`ActionPreflightFailure` ⇒ escalate. After the tool
     body was entered, any other exception means the state is UNKNOWN — this executor
     emits one honest terminal message and finishes normally; it must NEVER re-run the
     action through the Agent (that is how duplicate folders get made);
  4. ``{"ok": False, "reason"}`` = a DECIDED denial (approval refused, policy guard) —
     no side effect happened and re-asking the Agent would only re-trigger it; the
     denial is surfaced honestly as a terminal answer.

Everything before the first yielded event is pre-commit; the events after (content →
internal done, user+assistant rows persisted) mirror DIRECT exactly. No LLM call: the
confirmation text is the tool's own deterministic output.
