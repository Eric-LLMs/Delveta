Delveta is an **AI-native learning and research workspace** — a self-hosted environment for reading, watching, understanding, researching, and creating with your own materials, designed to keep your data and AI workloads within your own infrastructure and under your control. It combines a document and media workspace with AI chat, memory, RAG, agents, research workflows, and persistent knowledge, so your materials become an active part of the AI interaction rather than just file attachments.

Delveta supports PDFs, Office documents, video, audio, and images directly in the workspace, with integrated file management and personal cloud storage. Select a passage, page, or video moment and ask in context — then research beyond your materials, save durable insights, and turn conversations into reusable knowledge and artifacts.

Dive deeper: [**What you can do**](#what-you-can-do) explores the product, [**Engineering highlights**](#engineering-highlights) breaks down the system, and [**Architecture at a glance**](#architecture-at-a-glance) provides the system overview, with [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) documenting the full design.

## What is Delveta?

Delveta is a persistent AI learning and research assistant that helps you deeply understand your materials, investigate complex topics, and continuously build your own knowledge base — all within one self-hostable workspace.

**Why it's different:**

- **Learn with your material, not beside it.** Select and discuss passages while reading or watching, ask questions in context, and get grounded explanations and step-by-step breakdowns.

- **Your material is the starting point, not the boundary.** When your sources aren't enough, Delveta's Research OS automatically helps you investigate further across your own materials and external sources, so research can build on what you already know.

- **Learning insights become persistent knowledge.** Important insights become durable memory, while discussions and research can become summaries, mind maps, and slides that flow back into your searchable workspace, so you can pick up where you left off.

- **Built for individuals and teams.** Keep your materials and knowledge in your own workspace, or collaborate in shared workspaces with controlled access.

## <a id="engineering-highlights"></a>🔧 Engineering highlights

Delveta implements a controllable agent runtime rather than delegating orchestration to a rigid framework. Core architectural decisions and their production-grade implementations:

### Core AI Systems

- **Explicit agent orchestration.** A `ReactLoopAgent` step loop orchestrates model invocations and tool execution through a hot-reloadable, dependency-injected skill catalog and plugin runtime; a typed sandbox strictly gates every tool execution across `READ` / `WRITE` / `NETWORK` permissions, and a `SkillScopeEnforcer` guard hard-enforces each active skill's declared `allowed_tools` — a skill can never invoke a tool outside its scope, and unknown skill names fail closed. A lightweight `request_stop` signal enables safe task termination at step boundaries, keeping the generic agent loop fully decoupled from domain logic.
- **Persistent dual-track memory.** Two independent tracks share a single prompt boundary: the agent writes durable long-term memory via file-backed storage, while the system manages episodic session memory in PostgreSQL (`tsvector` + `pgvector` fused via RRF with recency decay). Chat Memory: client-authoritative live context with zero-SQL hot-path turns, asynchronous persistence, lossless single-layer compaction, and durable recovery. Relevant past sessions are recalled proactively, and user directives supersede in place rather than being deleted.
- **Cache-friendly prompts and tools.** A byte-stable prompt head (system identity + one-line tool index) paired with a dynamic per-step tail maximizes LLM prefix caching to slash latency and token costs, with a measurable cache identity. Tools use deferred loading: lightweight stubs are mounted first, and full parameter schemas are fetched only upon invocation.
- **Local Intent Funnel & Small-Model Routing.** Reduce LLM latency and token costs with a local intent-recognition funnel and a lightweight local model. Most routine, deterministic requests are resolved locally, while complex, low-confidence, or reasoning-intensive requests are escalated to online LLMs. A deterministic table Matcher and local vector Recall nominate registered capabilities for free; ONE call to a locally deployed small model (an OpenAI-compatible tool-intent service) both selects the capability and drafts its arguments, and a strict output Adapter binds the result regardless of which wire format the model emits (native function-calls or its structured Markdown block); anything the local chain cannot certify — negation, off-card invention, low confidence, missing or dirty arguments — falls open to the online frontier Agent with the user's text byte-identical.
- **Configurable retrieval.** A modular node RAG pipeline *(query rewrite → vector + keyword recall → RRF fusion → cross-encoder rerank → parent expansion → CRAG relevance checks)* can be reconfigured, reordered, or toggled live via the admin console without service restarts. Chunking is configured from the same RAG module — split strategy (`fixed` sliding window with configurable size + overlap, `paragraph`, `sentence`), plus the `contextual` (LLM-written context prefix per chunk), `parent_child` (small-to-big: index leaf chunks plus larger parent windows; recall searches leaves and a hit can surface its parent's fuller text), and `cjk` (jieba keyword segmentation) switches. A live chunking preview shows exactly how a strategy splits pasted text before you commit, and re-indexing applies the config. It also adds golden-set evaluation (`Recall@k`, `Precision@k`, `MRR`), Redis query caching (keyed by query + config + corpus version, auto-invalidated on re-index), and vision-LLM transcription for PDF tables. A single node failing degrades to the surviving channels instead of breaking the chat, and user feedback is logged to a golden evaluation dataset. Whole-session chat imports are incremental: an LLM segments a conversation into Q&A blocks and a per-message imported flag makes re-imports no-ops while re-importing a changed source replaces just its blocks. Every pipeline node records a per-node trace (status / timing / output) surfaced stage-by-stage in the admin Test tab, and the tenant-bound gRPC retrieval service enforces tenant scoping at the gate — token auth, token-bucket rate limiting, and an explicit guest flag — so no un-scoped call reads across tenants. Recall spans a unified multi-source corpus — drive files, learning sentences, and chat history — served in-process or via that gRPC service.
- **Grounded content compilation (decks & publication PDFs).** The content-to-slides engine designs a whole deck in one semantic pass over the raw sources — every fact carries a doc/page/line locator, figures land as real figure slides — then deterministic gates (wire-slip repair, jsonschema validation, a bounded single-slide patch loop) stand between the model and a local Typst compiler that renders the canonical 16:9 PDF alongside editable PPTX / Markdown / `deck.json`; nothing is ever silently trimmed, and every run records honest per-node LLM/render telemetry. The research Artifact Compiler closes the same doctrine on reports: PUBLISH projects the finalized manuscript into a Document AST and typesets a publication PDF with zero LLM in the path, resolving in-text citations back through the evidence graph, and a PDF fault never holds the Markdown publish hostage.
- **Governed research workflows (Research OS: Code-First Research Pipeline).** To eliminate workflow drift, redundant model calls, and cost escalation in long-chain autonomous agent navigation, Delveta restructures deep research into a decoupled architecture: a deterministic code-driven control plane paired with a bounded semantic engine—native code governs deterministic control flow, while the LLM is strictly reserved for tasks requiring semantic understanding, adjudication, and synthesis.
  - **Deterministic orchestration & bounded control flow**: The ten-stage DAG is explicitly defined and driven by Python state machines; the model does not route stages or pick tools, reducing hallucination-prone workflow drift and unnecessary decisions across long autonomous chains. Runs are locked at creation into strict (halts on unmet gates) or progressive (records diagnostic gaps and settles forward without fabricating passes) modes.
  - **Native code execution & parallel execution of independent work**: Algorithmic tasks (hashing, deduplication, sanitization, chunking, schema validation) run natively in code. Stages execute in a deterministic serial order, while heterogeneous sources within a stage fan out concurrently under SSRF guardrails, drastically cutting end-to-end latency while logging to an immutable provenance ledger.
  - **Wholesale semantic batching & materialized reuse**: Related semantic inferences are batched into as few model calls as practical. Intermediate evaluations and states are materialized into reusable research storage (in-memory state, fetch ledgers, and adjudication fingerprints), allowing downstream stages to reuse cached facts directly—minimizing redundant LLM queries and substantially slashing both token spend and response latency (with 100% page reuse, based on empirical run benchmarks).
  - **Strictly confined LLM footprint & pre-transport budget breaker**: LLMs handle reasoning and synthesis only (REPRODUCE and PUBLISH are strict 0-LLM nodes). Ordinary nodes enforce Attempt 1 → Validation → Attempt 2 (Repair-Once) for schema/format fixes only; EXECUTE follows an explicit two-beat contract (plan → deterministic execution → summary); and all calls route through llm_gate, gated pre-transport by a per-run budget circuit breaker (default budget: $0.40 USD; measured cost: ~$0.31) to prevent runaway token cost overruns.
  - **Server-owned execution, independent of the client**: A single turn atomically scaffolds the task and its mirrored workspace. Background arq workers chain one deterministic pipeline node per job (pipeline.run_node) to drive the run toward PUBLISH; client disconnections never interrupt server execution, while research_continuing and coalesced SSE revision hints keep the UI synchronized.
  - **Cooperative cancellation & crash resilience**: Cancellation is cooperative via atomic flags, safely persisting current node states at boundaries without abrupt mid-write kills. Resumed runs pick up from persisted state and avoid unnecessary re-execution where possible. Single-writer CAS (portalocker on monotonic revisions) prevents concurrent write corruptions, and heartbeat lease timeouts trigger idempotent same-turn adoptions that eliminate stale slots and double executions. Reaching PUBLISH never fakes completion—FINISHED is gated solely on physically persisted on-disk PROMOTED records.
### Production Infrastructure

- **Built-in reliability.** Hard timeouts and exponential-backoff retries absorb transient upstream LLM errors, bounded by a per-turn cost budget; concurrent streams keep their generators closure-local (never stored on the instance), so overlapping turns cannot cross-talk. Tool safety is enforced via a Redis pub/sub human-approval gate (deny on timeout), plan mode, bounded subagents, shadow-git checkpoints for state rollback, and a resource-capped, network-isolated Docker sandbox. Observability is built in: a trace context (`trace_id` / `turn_id` / `user_id` / `session_id`) flows through every agent turn, each turn emits a metric span (steps, tool latency, errors, cost), and a JSONL audit sink records decisions to disk.
- **Asynchronous job backbone.** Content enrichment, scheduled agent turns, and the toolkit's five-stage generation pipeline *(validate → ingest → generate → render → persist)* — producing summaries, mind maps, and slide decks — run on an arq worker, with a `jobs` table as the single source of truth and clients polling for progress. Contention is serialized by a per-asset ingest lock (auto-queue, manual import, and admin reindex race over each other's parent chunks), chunks are deleted then re-embedded in batches so a worker timeout loses only the uncommitted tail and re-runs are idempotent, job states stay honest — cancellation and non-terminal failures are recorded as such — and terminal failures land in a JSONL dead-letter.
- **Unified knowledge substrate.** Private My Drive and shared workspaces (featuring `Owner` / `Admin` / `Editor` / `Viewer` RBAC, member management, and append-only activity logs) sit atop a SHA-256 content-addressed object store with reference-counted deduplication, 8 MB resumable chunked uploads, multi-level folders, 30-day trash retention, per-file ACLs, workspace sharing, and integrated multi-format previews. Logical file trees map to content-addressed blobs — files sharing a digest share one physical copy — and object lifetime is managed by atomic reference counting with CAS-guarded physical deletion. The drive doubles as the shared data and working directory for content processing, retrieval, and agent workflows.
- **Resource-bound authorization.** Roles, tenant boundaries, upstream LLM provider credentials, model catalogs, and routing weights are managed from a unified admin console. It features a per-user key-grant matrix with masked credentials (`sk-***`), SMTP for email verification / password reset, and stateless signed admin sessions. Per-role LLM channels bind at login with automatic failover — users without a usable key degrade to the anonymous tier instead of losing login. Usage is metered by a free-first quota that overflows to a wallet; deductions are atomic (`UPDATE ... WHERE balance >= cost` prevents overdraft), snapshot `balance_after`, and are idempotent, returning HTTP 402 when funds run out.
- **Tenant-safe data isolation.** Request identity rides a ContextVar because the RAG and memory recallers are process-wide singletons that cannot take per-request constructor arguments; the same visibility predicate is written twice — once as a SQLAlchemy expression, once as a raw-SQL fragment — so the tsvector/pgvector recall path enforces the identical three channels (ownership, workspace membership, per-asset ACL with public links). Chunk-level predicates filter on `chunks.user_id` directly, so learning/chat chunks without an asset_id cannot leak past their owner. The vocabulary corpus uses partial unique indexes: public rows stay globally unique while each user's private rows are unique per user, so two users can each own a same-named term without colliding.
- **Local-first client, self-hostable infrastructure.** The Electron workbench supports offline file workflows (file tree, multi-format viewer, video frame capture); large media is processed on the client and the resulting artifacts submitted back to the server, while most content-processing workloads run server-side. Voice stays fully local too: push-to-talk dictation records `webm/opus` client-side and transcribes through a FunASR SenseVoiceSmall CPU sidecar, and a hands-free voice call is opened with one click — WebAudio energy-VAD segments speech, end-of-speech auto-sends (reasoning tokens suppressed only on call turns), Kokoro reads the answer aloud, and talking over playback barges in and interrupts; a call overlay paints a live spectrum. Videos become PPT/PDF study booklets: subtitle timestamps drive keyframe extraction, one frame plus its caption per page, with CJK-safe fonts so Chinese renders correctly; TTS auto-switches Chinese/English voices, synthesizes sentence-by-sentence so the first sentence plays back immediately, and caches waveforms by content hash for zero-latency replays. The complete backend stack — PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, TEI embeddings, Kokoro TTS, FunASR STT, and LiteLLM gateway — deploys seamlessly via `docker-compose`, keeping your workspace data and core backend services within your own infrastructure.
- **Authority / projection / index separation.** Three layers are explicitly decoupled: the server scratch directory is the single authority for task state and artifacts, the cloud-drive task folder is the user-visible projection (spec and session history update in place, and report artifacts mirror live into `outputs/<task name>.md` — no asset explosion), and promotion mints a per-run versioned `outputs/<stem>_vN.md` final flipped to RAG-pending to trigger indexing — the original upload path is no longer used.

## 🤗 Models & Artifacts

### Delveta LayaChoice

Delveta includes a fine-tuned LayaChoice model for local capability selection
and tool-intent routing. The current model is **v2** — a 4-way decision that
either selects a capability or explicitly `REJECT`s the candidate set.

- Model: [Delveta-LayaChoice-v2](https://huggingface.co/eric-ml-nlp/Delveta-LayaChoice-v2)
- Dataset: [Delveta-LayaChoice-v2-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eric-ml-nlp/Delveta-LayaChoice-v2-Data) · [`scripts/laya_finetune/V2/data/`](scripts/laya_finetune/V2/data/)
- Training code: [`scripts/laya_finetune/V2/`](scripts/laya_finetune/V2/)
- Checkpoints: [Delveta-LayaChoice-v2-checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/eric-ml-nlp/Delveta-LayaChoice-v2-checkpoints)
- Experiment record: [LayaChoice-v2 Fine-Tuning](docs/experiments/LayaChoice-v2-Fine-Tuning.md)

The model is used by the local Intent Funnel as a capability-selection model
([architecture.md §26](docs/architecture.md#26-layachoice-capability-selection)). The
production model artifact is hosted separately from the Delveta source repository.

> **Integration status.** The production `cap_router` and the `deploy/laya` sidecar still
> render the 3-option v1 question and emit no `REJECT` option; v2 is therefore **not yet
> wired into production**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — One-click launcher (recommended)

| Environment | Script |
|---|---|
| Windows desktop | `bash scripts/start_desktop.sh` |
| Linux server | `bash scripts/start_server.sh` |

Each script installs Docker if missing, starts the data + model services, ensures the Python environment, seeds the default `admin` / `pwd@Admin` account, and launches the workbench (desktop) or web UI (server).

### Option B — Manual local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eric-LLMs/Delveta.git
cd Delveta
conda create -n delveta python=3.11 -y && conda activate delveta
cp .env.example .env            # fill in LLM_UPSTREAM_KEY
pip install -e ".[dev]"         # + pip install -e ".[rag]" for semantic search
docker compose up -d postgres redis embedding tts llm-gateway worker
python scripts/init_db.py
uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload     # http://localhost:8300/docs
```

### Option C — LLM backend: self-hosted or external

The LiteLLM gateway routes the virtual model `delveta-chat` to any OpenAI-compatible upstream (`LLM_UPSTREAM_BASE`). Point it at a self-hosted server (vLLM / Ollama / …) to run the whole AI stack on your own hardware, or at an external provider — no code changes.

The LLM backend is independent of how you launch Delveta (Option A or B) and can be deployed separately.

## ⚙️ Configure Model Access

Sign in with the seeded account (**admin / `pwd@Admin`**), then open **Admin → Admin Console** from the bottom-left account menu to configure a model route:

1. **Providers → Credentials** — Add a provider credential with its API key and base URL.
2. **Providers → Model Catalog** — Register the models available through that credential.
3. **Providers → Routing & Weights** — Create a route by selecting a credential and model, then configure its priority and weight.
4. **Roles → Channels** — Bind the available provider channels to the roles that may use them (start with the `admin` role).

Once configured, the bound model routes are available to the corresponding roles.

> **How the model configuration works:**
> A **Credential** provides access to a provider. A **Model** defines which model to use. A **Route** connects a credential to a model. A **Channel** exposes one or more routes to a **Role**.

All LLM configuration is stored in the database and managed through the admin console.

If a provider runs out of balance, affected requests will return HTTP 402. Make sure each required channel has at least one active, funded route.
